Week 1 - 28/09/2023:
This week I have design and implemented the interface for the Sudoku page on the website. It contains the sudoku grid which 
is currently hardcoded and also buttons for the numbers which is used to fill the grid. I have also done some research on 
constraint solvers and the basics of machine vision. 
Next I will complete the web page for killer Sudoku and then start work on building a constraint solver for Sudoku.

Week 2 - 03/10/2023:
This week I have completed the the web design for the killer sudoku page on the website. Now both sudoku and killer sudoku can be played.
I have added some more styling to the web page to it's nicer to look at. In addition I have set up some classes for sudoku and killer Sudoku
so the grids and cages can now be stored in objects.
Next I will start work on the constraint solver for both types of puzzles using backtracking. 

Week 2 - 07/10/2023:
Since the last update I have implemented a simple solver for both sudoku and Killer sudoku which using backtracking and node consistency to
reduce the domain space for the cells. 
Next, I will implemented value order heuristic to both the solvers and see if and how they improve the solvers and then start working on the
report for these sections.

Week 3 - 12/1-/2023:
This week I have implemented value order heuristics for both the solvers by created a priority queue and choose the next cell to guess based 
on which cell has the smallest domain space. 
Next week I will write the report for the constraint solver section and being work on machine vision for sudoku.
