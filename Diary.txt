Week 1 - 28/09/2023:
This week I have design and implemented the interface for the Sudoku page on the website. It contains the sudoku grid which 
is currently hardcoded and also buttons for the numbers which is used to fill the grid. I have also done some research on 
constraint solvers and the basics of machine vision. 
Next I will complete the web page for killer Sudoku and then start work on building a constrint solver for Sudoku.
